  In the blog, the first article is "The more you lay down yourself, the happier you are".
 </p>
 <p>
  But the question is, whether you wanne be a happy idiot who live without yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three kinds of people in the world, basically.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most common groups, live in the others' expects, do what the society's rules write, they are, absolutely, not-too-happy happy idiots.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second groups, live in their own dreams, with great courage and incredible determination. They hope to achieve their original wish by sparing no effort, and obviously, are busy no-need-happy smart guys.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the last little groups, also live in their own dreams, but very easily and usual, as if they are born to know what's really means in the road, as if they are born to be an idiot.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wish I could live the third life, though it looks like to be very faraway.
 </p>
 <p>
  But it should be that hard, it depends on heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slow down the pace, bend down for some simple things, live beyond your desire, in a beautiful dreaming world, full of surprise.
