  Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both man and nature.

  A few days ago, in Changchun Invitation Contest, I first use this team nick in memory of my English teacher in my graduate period.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was a amazing teacher I have ever met in my university school days. Before it, I never treat English as a "really" lauguage which also contains history, elegance, beauty and so on. But by her, the door of a new colorful English world is opening for me. Just like Chinese, now I can enjoy the state of chasing interesting point in writing down English words, it comes solid, and with classical smell.
 </p>
 <p>
  As she said, she tought this class not only to teach us some words or some article, but also show her own perspective to life, world, culture, literature and more than those. Actually, she did it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each week, we have a speical homework to be finished, read an essay in NYT, CNN,guardia or some similar real time news website, and choose one corresponding with a theme, translate it. This some kinds of boring and heavy works widen my eyes a lot, and show me an approach to take a close look in the fresh life of the American and "Western" countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  She also introduced us a lot culture background in the class, as she both lived in US and UK for a while. "What's the happiest career in the world?" "The farmer in the American!" Then she talked to us about her experience in visiting a farm inAmerican, the causal and simple life, which drives me to be enchanted in the journey to the Yellow Stone Park, the clouds almost near to the ground, the cyan grass without a border, the breeze blowing on face from time to time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Sonnets of Shakespeare, what a miracle it is! Seven Daffodils, how a lively and cute rhythm! And the brief of Thoreau, the different viewpoints between cultures, the last goodbye and group photo... once it gone, it becomes to be a precious memory shining with gold lights.
 </p>
 <p>
  And transcendentalism, a word that longer than "Mynameisverylong", is a significant word she introduced to me. It can be the summary of my philosophy views. First, I believe the randomness of the world, so I don't trust experience very much, and not to say theory or science. So, don't limit yourself in any restriction, karma? fate? Retrieve the purity of a indivdual, be yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though I didn't figure out the solution of Problem J, I still like the name of Transcendentalism very much for its pun meaning.
 </p>
 <p>
  "Trans" Yourself!
